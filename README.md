Free Surface Flows Generated by a Moving Pressure Distribution

In this project, we investigated the free surface profile of a gravity-capillary wave generated by a moving pressure distribution. 

The main reference for the project is the book "Gravity-Capillary Free Surface Flows" by Jean-Marc Vanden-Broeck.

The Python code used to generate the plots in the presentation can also be found in this repository. 

In addition to the presentation, there is also some supplementary material, that further expounds on some ideas that were touched upon in the presentation, but had the potential to be explored in further depth.
